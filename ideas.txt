Experimental version $ 
Evil Islands Multi Player Vanilla-Like Mod

We are interested in changes like:

1/ new quests;

- new story, the old hero died and you are his succesor;

- new/old NPC's - for example you can get the quests in Gipath from Estera and Babur;

- chain story'ish quests - /if we can access source code/ - you will get the title for example %rareEnemyName Slayer.hero.name% which will allow you to get more difficult and rewarding quests; 

- grind quests for hunting/making money and searching for crafting materials;

- higher exp quests for those who want to learn by facing the death;


2/ new enemies;

3/ new items;

4/ new game mechanics;

- levels mechanics, when you get certain amount of exp you are at certain lvl, players with high levels can't help low level players to cheat;

- skill inc mechanics - like in old Tibia you will be able to skill your weapons and magic;

- new defense mechanics - no more standing still with max def;


5/ new maps;

6/ we need help with decompiling exe files;

7/ read the source code in c#;

8/ making new textures and models;

9/ gameplay balance;

10/ gameplay testing and bug report;
